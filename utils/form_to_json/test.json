  "description": "Divine Violence functions, in Daniel Joseph Martinez’s words, as 'a typology of every organization in the world that uses violence or aggression to fulfill its political ideology.' The installation is comprised of 125 panels, each of which bears the name of a political organization in black lettering on a wooden ground painted with automotive gold flake. These organizations represent diverse—and sometimes vehemently contradictory—aims and politics.",
