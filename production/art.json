The themes the artist was exploring seem perfectly in sync with Franco’s own hall-of-mirrors aesthetic: “make-up,” the stuff an actor smears on his face, assumes a double entendre as a verb—to make up, the very essence of any creative act. The video is the first in a new series by Chernick in which contemporary artists are enlisted to star in remakes of seminal video artworks, prompting a dialogue between the original artwork and the artist reinterpreting it.\"",
